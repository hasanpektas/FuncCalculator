# FuncCalculator
I have programmed a calculator that will allow the user to perform as many operations as he wants by keeping him on the console at all times. 
Each of the calculation processes has a separate function.
The user must first enter the desired operation ( + - / * % ) from the keyboard. 
Additional modes of calculation are included in the four operations.
If the value received from the user is not one of the above five symbols, the program will give an error. 
If the two numbers that it will enter later are redirected to the process that the user wants. 
If the user enters the letter “q” instead of selecting an operation, the program is terminated, otherwise the program can perform operations again after each calculation.
